# Using-Networkx-to-build-Hexagonal-Lattices

Many of my colleagues work in Solid State physics and work on materials that have Hexagonal Lattices. 

Using the Graphs from NetworkX package we can generate figures that display the lattices for great presentations to help teach others the beauty of materials such as graphene and the interesting physics they contain.
